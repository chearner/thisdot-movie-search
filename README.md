# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

README, please include details about the following: ○ Highlight something in your project that you thought was especially interesting or significant to your overall implementation. ○ Tell us what you are most pleased or proud of with your implementation. ○ Given more time, what next feature or improvement would you like to add to your project?
